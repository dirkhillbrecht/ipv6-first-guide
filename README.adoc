= IPv6-first network configurations with Linux and KVM

This repository contains a book which describes how to setup a Linux-based KVM hypervisor, virtual machines and services on them.
It follows an "IPv6-first" approach.
I.e. all systems are setup with IPv6 being the only mandatory IP protocol.
IPv4 is only added to reach services on virtual machines for clients which still do not have IPv6 connectivity.

This repository contains the Asciidoc sources for the book.
