== Operating-systems in the virtual machines

You can install any operating system which is capable of running in a virtualized setup. Of course, it _must_ be able to use IPv6 and it _should_ be able to auto-configure its network settings via SLAAC. Fortunately, all modern operating systems support such setups nowadays.

=== Ubuntu 20.04

We're now at a stage where you can install any operating system which is installable in KVM virtual machines. I give some advises for the Ubuntu 20.04 network installer:

* Install by simply pressing the "Install" button. I never needed any additional kernel parameters.
* Select correct keyboard or it will drive you nuts.
* Network autodetection will idle around when looking for the non-existing DHCP server. Keep calm. Apart from that, it will simply setup everything correctly.
* Enter the hostname, preferrably the same as the name of the virtual machine to keep it simple...
* Check whether you provider has their own mirror for the installation server. Hetzner has, therefore you can save download time:
** Go to top of mirror list and press `enter information manually`
** For Hetzner: `mirror.hetzner.de`. This server also works also with IPv6. But even IPv4 servers would be possible due to our NAT64/DNS64 setup.
** Set directory for the Hetzner server to `/ubuntu/packages/`
* You do not need a HTTP proxy.
* Install should start.
* I suggest to not partition the virtual hard disk in any way. It is not needed.
* Everything else is as usual. In the software selection, you should at least select the "OpenSSH server" so that you can log into the system after installation.

As this is Ubuntu 20.04, this machine uses netplan for network configuration. It has a very simple definition file in `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`:

.Netplan configuration in a Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine
----
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# For more information, see netplan(5).
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens3:
      dhcp6: yes
----

Netplan summarizes router advertisement in the "dhcp6" statement. You do not need to change anything here.

Note that after (re-)booting the virtual machine, it may take some seconds until it has configured its network interface. Once it has done so, everything should work without problems.

=== Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 is installed exactly the same way as Ubuntu 20.04.

=== Ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16.04 is installed almost exactly the same way as Ubuntu 20.04. The only difference is that Ubuntu 16.04 still uses `systemd-networkd` for network configuration.
Therefore, its network settings are located at a different place and also differ syntactically.
However, as with the more modern cousins, you do not have to change anything manually due to the autoconfiguration.

=== Windows 10

Windows "just works" when installed in an IPv6-only virtual machine.
It takes all the advertisements from `radvd` and configures its network appropriately.
The result is a Windows which has no IPv4 network aprt from the auto-configured one.
