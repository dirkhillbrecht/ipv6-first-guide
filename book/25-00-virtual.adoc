= The virtual machines

After the physical host is up and running, we can install the virtual machines.
They will carry the services which this machine actually will be used for.
Thie guide is not so much about virtualized environments in general but more about IPv6-first or IPv6-only setups.
However, we'll also look at the general virtual machine concepts.
